title: Version Control for the Humanities with Git
length: 3hr
---

In this workshop we will cover the basics of version control with Git geared
towards critical computing practice in the humanities. Appropriate for
students, authors, librarians, journal editors, and book publishers the
workshop explains the how and they why of version control. Together, we will
learn about the Git repository model, journaling, branches, forks and much
more. No previous experience is required to participate. In preparation start
thinking not about code but about manuscripts, genetic criticism, philology,
the making of critical editions, copy-text, textual witness, *recensio*, and
stemmata.

Goals for today:

1. To understand the ideas behind version control.
2. To internalize the model behind Git.
3. To learn a set of basic commands and to make your first push.

Bonus: To file a pull request to an existing project.
