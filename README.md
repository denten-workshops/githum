In this workshop we will cover the basics of version control with Git geared
towards critical computing practice in the humanities. Appropriate for
students, authors, librarians, journal editors, and book publishers the
workshop explains the how and they why of version control. Together, we will
learn about the Git repository model, journaling, branches, forks and much
more. No previous experience is required to participate. In preparation start
thinking not about code but about manuscripts, genetic criticism, philology,
the making of critical editions, copy-text, textual witness, *recensio*, and
stemmata.
